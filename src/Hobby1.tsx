            <p>Thrifting is a hobby of mine that connects me to my high school friends. We don't see each other often, with everyone
                being scattered across the country for college. However, whenever we are able to get together, we almost always go
                thrifting together! Though many people think thrifting is tedious and boring, I appreciate the time spent mindlessly picking
                through clothes and catching up with my best friends. Some of my favorite pieces of clothing are items I've found at
                thrift shops!</p>
