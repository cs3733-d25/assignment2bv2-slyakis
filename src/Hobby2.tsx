            <p>One of my hobbies is baking! I like doing it with friends as it is a fun and rewarding activity to bond over.
                My favorite experience was a cupcake decorating workshop I attended where I got to learn about different decorating methods and try them out myself!
                I also did the blind, death, mute baking challenge while making a cake with my friends, where two of us were blindfolded, one couldn't speak, and one couldn't hear.</p>
